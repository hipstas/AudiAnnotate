# AudiAnnotate Workshop 
## Thursday, May 28, 2020 12-2pm CST

[Workshop agenda](agenda.md): This introductory workshop will include basic information about [the AudiAnnotate project](http://hipstas.org/audiannotate/), about using [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) and the [IIIF specifications for AV](https://iiif.io/community/groups/av/), how we are using Audacity to annotate audio files, and how we are using static sites, Jekyll, and GitHub to manage editing and publishing IIIF manifests and annotations. 

The workshop will be presented virtually via Zoom. Please [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO-Rf_QeqYDB6KXKhqwwvYYzCkKUJ8fs9Fg7Ysv5lBdrI_Vw/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we can contact you with the link. 

#### Workshop Prep
Before the workshop, we request that you: 

1. [Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=free&ref_cta=Create%2520a%2520free%2520organization&ref_loc=topcarousel&ref_page=%2Fpricing) to do so. 

2. Download Audacity. There will be an optional opportunity to incorporate Audacity, an open-source audio editing application, into the AudiAnnotate workflow. If you are interested in participating, please download Audacity before the workshop. You can find instructions [here](workflow.md).

3. Find an audio file. You can bring your own audio to the workshop, but the audio needs to be accessible via a direct URL to that file. Follow these [instructions](workflow.md) for uploading an audio file to Box, DropBox, or the Internet Archive in order to create a URL. We will also have audio available for you to use on the workshop day.
