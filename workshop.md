Before the workshop, we request that you: 

1. [Create a GitHub Account.](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=free&ref_cta=Create%2520a%2520free%2520organization&ref_loc=topcarousel&ref_page=%2Fpricing) 

2. Download Audacity. There will be an optional opportunity to incorporate Audacity, an open-source audio editing application, into the AudiAnnotate workflow. If you are interested in participating, please download Audacity before the workshop. You can find instructions [here](workflow.md).

3. Find an audio file. You can bring your own audio to the workshop, but the audio needs to be accessible via a direct URL to that file. Follow these [instructions](workflow.md) (navigate to "Part 4: Getting an Audio Link for Your Project") for uploading an audio file to Box, DropBox, or the Internet Archive in order to create a URL. We will also have audio available for you to use on the workshop day.
