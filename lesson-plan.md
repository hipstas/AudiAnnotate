# Lesson Plans

The lessons below serve as an introduction to annotation as a method for understanding sensitive audiovisual resources, structuring annotations in a machine-readable format, and uploading and presenting audio annotations using the [AudiAnnotate application](http://audiannotate.brumfieldlabs.com/). Both lessons focus on engaging with sensitive archival material in individual or group settings. The first lesson may also be read as a general introduction to annotating with AudiAnnotate, but includes tips for classroom settings. The second lesson is structured as a more traditional classroom lesson plan. The pages throughout the lesson serves as guides for teachers and students.
