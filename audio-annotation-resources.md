#### General Annotation

- This article presents the annotation tool ELAN as part of a larger annotation framework for classifying and annotating linguistic elements in recordings.

- This article shares information about the development of digital infrastructure for AV linguistic research data at the Hamburg Centre for Language Corpora (HZSK) at the University of Hamburg in Germany. The author also discusses annotation and visualization of annotation for AV materials.

- BAT is a tool that exists to “provides an easy way to annotate the salience of simultaneous sound sources” and to “define multiple ontologies to adapt to multiple tasks and offers the possibility to cross-annotate audio data.” This web-based tool and framework allows for annotation of audio events and cross-annotation by multiple users.

- The goal of the YUMA framework is to advance scholarly annotation and “provide integrated collaborative annotation functionality for digital library portals and online multimedia collections.” Though it is called a framework, the article suggests that it is actually an application that provides a way to collect and document annotations. 

#### Library/Archive Specific Annotation

- This article talks about a project between the Studs Terkel Radio Archive and the Library of Congress to enrich and enhance usability and accessibility. While it is not explicitly related to annotation standards, the article does talk about metadata standards used for this audio collection. They discuss how they developed and maintained their own local descriptive terms that were added as “tags” by project workers as they listened to audio. Metadata was then enriched with the identification of “thematic clips” in three categories.

- This work is in the area of Music information retrieval (MIR), and surveys the existing classification frameworks in MIR. They evaluate and discuss feature taxonomies in music genre, mood, artist identification, instrument recognition, and annotation.
