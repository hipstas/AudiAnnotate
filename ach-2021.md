# AudiAnnotate @ The Association for Computers in the Humanities

7/21/2021

The AudiAnnotate project facilitates annotating archival audiovisual (AV) collections to accelerate access to, promote scholarship with, and extend our understanding of a diverse range of bygone timeframes, cultures, and contexts. Following the tenets of minimal computing, we  use the newest IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) AV standard, GitHub public code and document repositories, and freely accessible AV presentation platforms (Universal Viewer) to produce, publish, and sustain shareable W3C Web Annotations for individual and collaborative AV projects. This panel demonstrates projects where interpretations have been made more discoverable and usable, opening up conversations about the AV medium and accessibility in areas such as race, gender, and cultural studies. After a five minute introduction to the project, six participants will speak for 5 minutes, leaving 25 minutes for discussion.

Introduction to AudiAnnotate

**Jason Camlot**

The first presentation will compare two distinct audio recordings of the same event: “Warren Tallman’s Retirement Speech at UBC Nov 27, 1986”. Each recording comprises segments produced in different times and spaces. The presenter will describe how Tallman’s comments upon sounds from these differing segments represent disruptive, microgeneric, audio-textual interpolations. The process for annotating this recording is a primary method that includes parsing, describing and theorizing complex sonic entities that influence higher-level, critical textual analysis.

The second presentation investigates poetic voice and address on screen in Sarah Colangelo’s 2018 film *The Kindergarten Teacher*. Annotating scenes from the film for AudiAnnotate shaped the presenter’s dissertation chapter “Right Voice, Wrong Body: *The Kindergarten Teacher*, Poetic Address, and Voice as Possession” by allowing them to observe how the film’s form reveals poetic voice as dialogic and public as opposed to a monologic, private utterance as lyric theory often proposes.
